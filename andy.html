                        <h4>Project Eliza (Chat Box)</h4>
                        <li>
                            Developed a Java program where a user would input a sentence and the program would print random 
                            statements depending on specific words and ending punctuation of the UI. Created arrays that stored
                            a collection of string statements for the chatbot. Designed an “If-Else” algorithm for decision branching
                            for the users input, calling methods to get a random statement from an array to print it, looping for repetition 
                            until UI exits.

                        <h4>Minesweeper</h4>
                        <li>
                            A game where the UI searches for hidden bombs on a grid. The grid is represented by a grid of booleans creating the bomb locations. 
                            The game is won when all cells not containing the true value which is the bomb locations have been clicked on by the UI.
                            Created GUI using the java Swing package, displaying the grid and creating JButtons in each cell with its own active listener to determine 
                            whether the cell has bomb or not when UI interacted with it, also informing users whether the game has been won or lost via JOptionPane.

                        <h4>Festival Menu</h4>
                        <li>
                            Developed a Java program that interacts with the user allowing them to choose from food menu options by using its associated item number, 
                            displaying the user’s order at the end of the program. Creating a loop to be able to control the menu, also storing the UI to display order.
